How the beautiful soup python library works.

First it pulls data out of HTML and XML files.
It then transforms the HTML into a complex tree of Python objects.
Finally, it provides methods to navigate, search and modify the complex tree of objects.

Beautiful Soup Parsers.
We could use the html.parser or the lxml parser. The lxml parser we need to install with pip.
